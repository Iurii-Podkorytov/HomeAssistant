# WLED Timer Animation Automation

This section guides you through creating an animation on your WLED device that visualizes a countdown timer in Home Assistant. This is achieved by using the WLED Liveview Proxy integration to send real-time pixel data to a WLED device based on the remaining time of a Home Assistant timer.

---

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

* **Home Assistant:** A running instance of Home Assistant.
* **WLED Device:** A WLED-enabled device (e.g., an ESP32 with addressable LEDs) connected to your network and configured with WLED firmware.

---

### 1. Install HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)
Instuctions to install [HACS](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/#to-download-hacs)

### 2. Install WLED Liveview Proxy Integration

This custom integration allows Home Assistant to send pixel-level commands to your WLED device.

**Steps:**

 * **Navigate to HACS:** In Home Assistant, go to `HACS` in the sidebar.
 * **Go to Integrations:** Click on `Integrations`.
 * **Explore & Download Repositories:** Click on the three dots in the top right corner, then select `Custom repositories`.
 * **Add WLED Liveview Proxy Repository:**
    * **Repository URL:** `https://github.com/danishru/wled_liveviewproxy`
    * **Category:** `Integration`
    * Click `ADD`.
 * **Search for WLED Liveview Proxy:** Go back to the HACS Integrations page and search for "WLED Liveview Proxy".
 * **Download the Integration:** Click on the "WLED Liveview Proxy" integration and then click `Download`.

### 3. Add WLED Device to Home Assistant

Once WLED Liveview Proxy is installed, you can add your WLED device as an integration.

**Steps:**

1.  **Go to Devices & Services:** In Home Assistant, navigate to `Settings` > `Devices & Services`.
2.  **Add Integration:** Click on `+ Add Integration`.
3.  **Search for WLED Liveview Proxy:** Search for "WLED Liveview Proxy".
4.  **Configure the Integration:**
    * You will be prompted to enter the IP address of your WLED device. Enter it and enable the control mode.

### 4. Create a timer
Go to `Settings` > `Devices & Services` > `Helpers` > `Create Helper` > `Timer` and create a new timer. Give it a name `wled_countdown` and some duration (e.g. 5 minutes).

### 5. Create the WLED Timer Animation Automation

**Steps:**

1.  **Navigate to Automations:** In Home Assistant, go to `Settings` > `Automations & Scenes` > `Automations`.
2.  **Create New Automation:** Click on `+ Create Automation`.
3.  **Switch to YAML Mode:** In the top right corner, click on the three dots and select `Text editor`.
4.  **Paste the Automation Code:** Replace the existing content with the following YAML code. **Replace `YOUR_WLED_DEVICE_ID` with the actual device ID of your WLED device.**

### How the Automation Works

This automation is triggered when your `timer.wled_countdown` changes to an `active` state. It then enters a `repeat` loop that continues until the timer becomes `idle`.

Inside the loop:

1.  **Variables Calculation:**
    * It calculates the total duration of the timer and the remaining time in seconds.
    * `pixels_total` is set to the total number of LEDs on your strip.
    * `lit_pixels` is calculated based on the ratio of `remaining_seconds` to `duration_seconds`, determining how many LEDs should be lit to represent the remaining time.
2.  **WLED Command:**
    * It sends a `wled_liveviewproxy.send_command` service call.
    * This command consists of two segments (`seg`):
        * The first segment sets all pixels to black (off).
        * The second segment then lights up a certain number of pixels (`lit_pixels`) from the beginning of the strip in green (00ff00) with a brightness of 100.
3.  **Loop Condition:** The `repeat` loop continues until the `timer.wled_countdown` entity changes its state to `idle`, meaning the timer has finished.
4.  **Timer Finished Action:** Once the timer finishes, the `if` condition triggers, sending a final command to the WLED device to turn all pixels off, ensuring a clean state after the countdown.
